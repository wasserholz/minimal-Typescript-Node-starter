# minimal-Typescript-Node-starter
A minimal template to get started with nodeJs and TypeScript

License: MIT

# Get Started
* clone the repository
* run `npm i`


# Development - Commands
* `npm run serve`       - run local instance of the server
* `npm start`           - run local instance of the server
* `npm run watch`       - watch changes on the code base and restart local instance on changes
* `npm run watch-debug` - same as `npm watch`, but providing debug functionality
* `npm run build`       - build the codebase


`npm run watch-debug` integrates nicely with VS Code.
Activate `Debug > Node: Auto Attach` in VS Code and your debugger automatically attaches to the running instance after you have saved your code changes.
